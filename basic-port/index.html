                        Hello! My name is Jacob Vassas and I am a student in Cleveland, Ohio. For my undergraduate degree, I am enrolled at Cleveland State University where my major is Health Science with a minor in Business. My expected graduation date is December 2018. Aside from CSU, I am also enrolled in Case Western Reserve's Coding Bootcamp.

                    <p>
                        My professional experience consists of working in the I.T. field at different levels. In 2018, I began interning at Mercy Regional Hospital in Lorain, Ohio in the Health Informatics department. Coinciding with working at Mercy, I have done work within my family's business, Vassas Telecommunications Consulting (VTC) since 2016. VTC specializes in voice and data audit analysis and voice, data and I.T. consulting.

                        When I am neither working, or studying, I bartend part-time in downtown Cleveland. My total experience consists of 3 years and my favorite cocktail is an Old Fashioned. This may seem to be a very hectic schedule but I believe that staying busy is extremely beneficial when striving towards goals. My interests include technology, large cities and urban areas, food, travel, and Cleveland sports teams, the Cavs, Indians and yes, the Browns
